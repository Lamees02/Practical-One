# Question 1
## Find rows with missing values
```{r}
missing <- airquality[rowSums(is.na(airquality)) >0, ]
missing
```

# Question 2
## Summary Statistics for Ozone
```{r}
mean(airquality$Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(airquality$Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)
min(airquality$Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)
max(airquality$Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Summary Statistics for Temperature

```{r}
mean(airquality$Temp, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(airquality$Temp, na.rm = TRUE)
min(airquality$Temp, na.rm = TRUE)
max(airquality$Temp, na.rm = TRUE)
```


# Question 3
## Response Variable
```{r}
Y <- cars$dist
```
## Design Matrix
