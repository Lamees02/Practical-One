Question 1

```{r}
#Find rows with missing values
missing <- airquality[rowSums(is.na(airquality)) >0, ]
missing
```

Question 2

```{r}
#Mean Values
mean(airquality$Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)
mean(airquality$Temp, na.rm = TRUE)
#Standard Deviations
sd(airquality$Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(airquality$Temp, na.rm = TRUE)
#Minimums
min(airquality$Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)
min(airquality$Temp, na.rm = TRUE)
#Maximums
max(airquality$Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)
max(airquality$Temp, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Question 3

```{r}
#Response Variable
Y <- cars$dist
#Design Matrix
X <- cbind(1, cars$speed)
#Parameter Estimates
b_hat <- solve( t(X) %*% (X) ) %*% t(X) %*% Y
b_hat
```

Question 4
